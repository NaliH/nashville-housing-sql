Data Cleaning with SQL

This project takes a raw dataset of Nashville housing data, that was obtained online, and cleans the data with SQL in SSMS.

Some functions used (among others) are:
* PARSENAME()
* SUBSTRING()
* CHARINDEX()
* ISNULL()

The functions were used to clean the data by:
* Standardizing date formats
* Standardizing string data (addresses and binary values)
* Filling missing data
* Removing irrelevant data
